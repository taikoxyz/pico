# tainnel roadmap

> **Target:** dogfood / private launch on Taiko mainnet. USDC only, full 1-hop routing,
> one watchtower. **CLI-only user surface — no browser wallet UI.** ~1–2 months
> end-to-end. DVM, ETH support, and ERC-8004 agent identity are Phase-2 follow-ups.

This roadmap is the bird's-eye view. Each phase has a detailed plan in
[`docs/plans/`](./docs/plans/). Work the phases in order unless explicitly marked
parallelizable.

## Tag conventions

| Tag        | Meaning                                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `[agent]`  | Pure typing/grunt work. Hand to a coding agent with the file as context. |
| `[human]`  | Needs your judgment, signature, or access. Decisions, deploys, key ops. |
| `[review]` | Agent did the work; you read the diff before merge.                      |

A `[human]` task may be *prepared* by an agent (e.g., draft a deploy script) but the
agent must stop before pressing the button.

### Parallelism opportunities

P2/P3/P4 are complete (P2 code-complete; only mainnet ops gates remain). P6
is 🟢 done. P5 has a working first cut covering the SDK wire contract end to
end. The remaining fan-out is:

- **P5 follow-ups** (signed-envelope auth, anvil-backed integration,
  coverage gate) can land independently from P7.
- **P7 (CLI)** — can start now. `apps/cli/` already has the commander.js
  scaffold + command stubs (`channel open/list/close`, `pay`, `hub status`)
  and depends on `@tainnel/sdk`. The remaining work is wiring those stubs to
  the SDK and adding a `PrivateKeyWalletAdapter` to the SDK so the CLI can
  sign on the Node side. Runs end-to-end against the P4 mock hub today;
  switch the `--hub` flag once P5 follow-ups land.

---

## What to work on next

P0–P4 are complete from an engineering standpoint. P6 (watchtower) is 🟢
done and P5 (hub) has a working first cut.

1. **P5 follow-ups** — to flip from 🟡 partial to 🟢 done:
   - Signed-envelope WebSocket auth (D5.2). The wire handler accepts a bare
     `{id, kind, payload}` today; wrap it with `{nonce, ts, payload, sig}`
     verification. The `seen_nonces` table is already in place.
   - Anvil-backed integration: replace the chain mock in
     `apps/hub/test/integration.test.ts` with a real anvil run plus the
     deployed contracts (this also gates P10's dispute drill). The current
     test mocks the chain and is marked `// TODO P10`.
   - Coverage report: `pnpm --filter @tainnel/hub test --coverage`. The
     vitest threshold of ≥70% is set; current numeric coverage is unmeasured.
2. **P7 (CLI)** — unblocked. The `apps/cli/` scaffold + command stubs
   already exist; fill them in against the SDK and add
   `PrivateKeyWalletAdapter` to the SDK. Point it at the hub's `WS /v1/ws`
   (or, for pure offline work, the SDK's existing `startMockHub`).

### Outstanding mainnet ops gates (P10 prereqs, not P5 blockers)

The contracts code is hub-ready, but two `[human]` gates must close before
real users deposit USDC on mainnet. They do **not** block hub
implementation — that work can target Hoodi testnet or a local fork.

- **Smoke channel.** Open a ≤ MIN_CHANNEL_AMOUNT channel on mainnet and
  confirm `ChannelOpened` on Taikoscan. Currently blocked by the deployer
  (`0x327fa3...c458`) holding 0 USDC.
- **Owner-key rotation.** The deployer key is the current owner of both
  proxies and was pasted into a Claude session — treat as compromised.
  `transferOwnership` from a clean key before any real user funds.

## Decisions still open

These are all `[human]` decisions surfaced from sub-plans, indexed here so you can
scan them in one place. Each has a default; accepting defaults across the board is the
"dogfood path".

| Phase | Decision | Default | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| P5 | Hub DB in production | sqlite + litestream | [05](./docs/plans/05-hub.md#decisions) |
| P5 | Hub WebSocket auth | signed message per request | [05](./docs/plans/05-hub.md#decisions) |
| P6 | Watchtower deployment mode | self-hosted only | [06](./docs/plans/06-watchtower.md#decisions) |
| P6 | Penalty trigger threshold | 50% of dispute window | [06](./docs/plans/06-watchtower.md#decisions) |
| P7 | CLI keystore handling | `TAINNEL_PRIVATE_KEY` env var | [07](./docs/plans/07-cli.md#decisions) |
| P9 | Hosting platform | Fly.io | [09](./docs/plans/09-ops.md#decisions) |
| P9 | Watchtower placement | separate region from hub | [09](./docs/plans/09-ops.md#decisions) |
| P9 | Alert destination | Discord webhook | [09](./docs/plans/09-ops.md#decisions) |
| P10 | Per-user channel cap | 100 USDC | [10](./docs/plans/10-launch.md#decisions) |
| P10 | Initial hub liquidity | 1000 USDC | [10](./docs/plans/10-launch.md#decisions) |

## Glossary (just enough to read the sub-plans)

- **Channel** — a 2-of-2 escrow on-chain between two parties (typically client + hub).
  Funds are deposited once on open, then balances move off-chain via signed updates.
- **State** — a snapshot of a channel: `(balanceA, balanceB, htlcs[], version)` signed
  by both parties. Versions only go up.
- **Cooperative close** — both parties sign a final state and settle in one tx. The
  happy path. Fast and cheap.
- **Unilateral close** — one party (e.g., the hub disappeared) posts the latest state
  they have on-chain. Opens a **dispute window**.
- **Dispute window** — a fixed delay (e.g., 24h) before the unilaterally-posted state
  becomes final, giving the counterparty time to challenge with a newer signed state.
- **HTLC** (Hash-Time-Locked Contract) — a conditional payment inside a channel:
  "$X is locked. Whoever reveals the preimage of hash H before time T claims it.
  Otherwise it refunds." This is how 1-hop routing stays trust-minimized: the hub is
  paid only if the recipient reveals.
- **Watchtower** — a bot that watches the chain for fraudulent old-state submissions
  and posts a counter-state before the dispute window closes. May be self-hosted or a
  third-party service.
- **EIP-712** — Ethereum's typed-data signing standard. Channel states are signed as
  EIP-712 typed data so wallets show humans-readable fields, not raw bytes.
- **1-hop routing** — payments flow `client → hub → recipient` via two paired HTLCs.
  No multi-hop, no graph gossip, no onion routing. Dramatically simpler than Lightning.
- **Hub** — a long-running operator that holds channels with many users and routes
  payments between them. Analogous to a Lightning LSP.
- **Hot wallet** — a private key on a server. Convenient, capped at low balance.
- **Litestream** — a tool that continuously streams a SQLite DB to S3-compatible
  storage for backup and point-in-time restore.

## Done when

The project is "dogfood production ready" when **every gate** below is green:

- [ ] All 10 sub-plans report status 🟢
- [ ] Contracts deployed + verified on Taiko mainnet
- [ ] Hub + watchtower running on production infra with monitoring + alerts
- [ ] One end-to-end mainnet payment (CLI process A → hub → CLI process B) succeeds with real USDC
- [ ] Dispute drill on mainnet (≤ MIN_CHANNEL_AMOUNT funds): a deliberately-stale state
      submission is penalized by the watchtower within the dispute window
- [ ] 2-week soak: 3–5 dogfood users, no funds lost, alerts behaved correctly
- [ ] Post-launch retro written, follow-up phase 2 issues filed (DVM, ETH, multi-hub, ERC-8004 agent identity)
